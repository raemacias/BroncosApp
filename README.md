# BroncosApp
This is the project from Lesson 4 of Android Basics, the Score Keeper App.

I customized it to football, using my favorite team as the home team.
I used the official team colors in the app and instead of plain text for each team I chose to add an image.
The buttons all work and the score can be easily reset.
